# PhoneBankSimulation

This is another project for my 311 Java class at Eastern Michigan University. The project outline, as well as a sample run provided by the professor, is posted in this repository. The idea is that it's a phone bank of callers
looking to access some sort of database. The database is irrelevant, it's all about the Queue of callers that are dialing in, being put into the queue, possibly using a phone bank, then hanging up. The simulation simulates
how many of the callers get turned away, and the simulation runs off of user input variables that are initialized before the simulation begins.
